  	  		<h2>Game Client</h2>
  	  		<p>The game client is used to register a game in the API, authenticate a user and to fetch its data.</p>

  	  		<h3>Examples</h3>
  	  		<h4>Register a game and authenticate a user</h4>
  	  		<div hljs hljs-language="cs">GameClient client = new GameClient("gameId", "gameKey");
// The first user who is authenticated will be set as default user in the Settings class.
client.AuthenticateUser("username", "token");</div>
			<p>Alternatively you can also register a game like this:</p>
			<div hljs hljs-language="cs">client.RegisterGame("gameId", "gameKey");</div>
			<p>If the authentication is completed the <code>AuthenticationCompleted</code> event is fired.</p>
			<h4>Fetch user data</h4>
			<div hljs hljs-language="cs">// You can fetch users by their id..
IEnumerable<User> users = client.FetchUser(101, 500, 524);
// ..or by their username.
User user = client.FetchUserByName("username");</div>
			<p>If the user data is fetched the <code>FetchUserCompleted</code> event is fired.</p>

			<h2>Settings</h2>
			<p>The game and user data is saved in the <code>Settings</code> class which is implemented as singleton. 
			   There you can also set the current default user who is used as default in all functions with an user parameter.</p>
			<p>To specify the default user use the <code>SetCurrentUser</code> function in the <code>Settings</code> class.</p>
			<div hljs hljs-language="cs">Settings.Instance.SetCurrentUser("username");</div>
  		</div>
  	</div>
